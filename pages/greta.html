                            We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis
                            And we need to call it what it is
                            An emergency
                            We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control
                            And that we don't have all the solutions yet
                            Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things

                            We must admit that we are losing this battle
                            We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed
                            All political movements in their present form have failed
                            But Homo sapiens have not yet failed
                            Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around
                            We can still fix this
                            We still have everything in our own hands
                            But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems
                            We most probably don't stand a chance

                            We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people
                            And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say
                            Now is the time to speak clearly
                            Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced
                            The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it
                            We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases
                            And either we do that, or we don't
                            You say that nothing in life is black or white
                            But that is a lie, a very dangerous lie

                            Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don't
                            Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don't
                            Either we choose to go on as our civilization, or we don't
                            That is as black or white as it gets
                            Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Now, we all have a choice
                            We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations
                            Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail

                            That is up to you and me
                            And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change
                            But you cannot have one without the other
                            If you look through history
                            All the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level
                            People like you and me
                            So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible
                            To do your best is no longer good enough
                            We must all do the seemingly impossible

                            Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day
                            There are no politics to change that
                            There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground
                            So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules
                            Because the rules have to be changed
                            Everything needs to change, and it has to start today

                            So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience
                            It is time to rebel
